What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge creates a new commit in the progress branch with an updated version of the file with changes from the main branch, while a rebase creates new commits for every commit in the progress branch, tacking all of the new commits onto the main branch.

What is a remote repository?

A central online repository visible to collaborators.
